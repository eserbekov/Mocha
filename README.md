# Homework Unit testing. Mocha and Chai.
#### This project contains functions and tests for them written using Mocha and Chai.

* Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js 
and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. 
Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, 
while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Hosted on GitHub.

* Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and 
the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

Project contains files: 
** index.js - our functions;
** index.spec.js - tests to our functions;
** package-lock.json - contains all necessary settings;
** Readme.md - project description.
