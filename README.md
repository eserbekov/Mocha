# Homework Unit testing. Mocha, Chai and ESlint.
#### This project contains functions and tests for them written using Mocha and Chai.

* Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js 
and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. 
Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, 
while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Hosted on GitHub.

* Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and 
the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.

* ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions:
  - ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.
  - ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
  - ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.
 - Getting Started with ESLint.
   - You can install ESLint using npm : npm install eslint --save-dev.
   - You should then set up a configuration file: npx eslint --init.
   
* Project contains files: 
  - index.js - our functions;
  - index.spec.js - tests to our functions;
  - package-lock.json - contains all necessary settings;
  - Readme.md - project description;
  - .eslint.json - contains configuration ESlint.
